## Installation
A homebrew enabled PS3 with WebMAN is required. Then use [RaCMAN](https://github.com/MichaelRelaxen/racman).  

When you have RacMAN working, attach it to the game, go to "Patches loader..." in the top-left menu, then choose "Add ZIP..." and find the randomizer.zip download. Then just enable it in the mod menu.

## Set seed
To make a set seed, make a text file named `seed.txt` in RaCMAN's root folder (the upper folder where `racman.exe` is). The text file can contain any type of text. Newlines count as a character, meaning `oiejfoiwjef` and `oiejfoiwjef` with a new line at the end are different seeds.
